you can use script under vb_merge folder to merge FrameAnalysisDump Files ,and then import it into Blender by DarkStarSward's 3dmigoto blender plugin.
and when you export it as vb format ,you need to use script under vb_split folder to split vb file to correct parts, so you can import it into game.
