# Notes
1.Fixs is located at discord's FIXS&RESOURCES RELEASE category.
These fix may only work on NVDIA graphics,and may work on AMD graphics incorrectly.
Use these fix may let you get banned for 30 days or forever, depends on luck.

you can use script under vb_merge folder to merge FrameAnalysisDump Files , 
and then import it into Blender by DarkStarSward's 3dmigoto blender plugin.

and when you export it as vb format ,you need to use script under vb_split folder to split vb file to correct parts, 
so you can import it back into game.

For convenience,  It's better to use NarakaLoaderV1.0 ,so you can correctly import vb file into game, 
and you can press F3 to open or close the fix.

# DISCLAIMER
I strongly recommend only using private servers or Single-Player Game for modding. 

Using these tools on Muilti-Player Game servers carries a high risk of being banned. 

I do not condone the use of these tools and programs on official servers, 

and take no responsibility for any consequences as a result if you do.
