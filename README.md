# Notes
1.The fixs may only work on NVDIA graphics,and may work on AMD gpu incorrectly.

2.Use these fixs may let you get banned for 30 days or forever, depends on luck.

3.If any fix broke with version update ,please open an issue, thanks!

you can use script under vb_merge folder to merge FrameAnalysisDump Files ,and then import it into Blender by DarkStarSward's 3dmigoto blender plugin.
and when you export it as vb format ,you need to use script under vb_split folder to split vb file to correct parts, so you can import it into game.

For convenience,  It's better to use GIMI version 3dmigoto ,so you can correctly import vb file into game.

# DISCLAIMER
I strongly recommend only using private servers or Single-Player Game for modding. 

Using these tools on Muilti-Player Game servers carries a high risk of being banned. 

I do not condone the use of these tools and programs on official servers, 

and take no responsibility for any consequences as a result if you do.
